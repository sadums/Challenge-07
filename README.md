# README Generator

## Description

I built this project to help myself and others with the tedious task of writing a README. It is a CLI program that will prompt you questions to fill the read me. I built this project using Node.js and the Inquirer package.

## Installation

To install download the zip file in this repository.

## Usage

To use navigate the the downloaded directory through the terminal. Then, run these commands, "npm i" "node index.js". It will lead you through a series of prompts to answer. If you want to leave a section empty, just press enter. After the prompts are completed, your README file will be in the "generated_README" folder.  Refer to the video below if needed.
